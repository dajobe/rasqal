  <title>Rasqal RDF Query Library - Building and Installing from Source</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Rasqal RDF Query Library - Building and Installing from Source</h1>

<h2>1. Getting the sources</h2>

<p>There are several ways to get the sources.  The most stable and
tested versions are the sources shipped with each release and these
are recommended as the first place to start.  If you want to get a
newer set, then there are nightly snapshots made of the development
sources, which may not yet be committed to GIT.  For the
latest development sources, anonymous GIT access is available
but this may require some configuring of developer tools that are not
needed for the snapshot releases.
</p>

<p>The source bundle and package files contain all the HTML files and
documentation provided on the web site.
</p>

<h2>1.1 Getting the sources from releases</h2>

<p><b>This is the recommended source to build and install Rasqal.</b>  It
ensures that a tested and working set of files are used.</p>

<p>The sources are available from
<a href="http://download.librdf.org/source/">http://download.librdf.org/source/</a>.</p>


<h2>1.2 Getting the sources from GIT</h2>

<p><b>This is the recommended source for developers</b>.  It provides
the latest beta or unstable code.  For a stable version, use a release
as described above.</p>

<pre>
  git clone git://github.com/dajobe/rasqal.git
  cd rasqal
</pre>

<p>At this stage, or after a <tt>git pull</tt> you will
need to create the automake and autoconf derived files, as described
below in <a href="#sec-create-configure">Create the configure program</a>
by using the <code>autogen.sh</code> script.</p>

<p>Building Rasqal in this way requires some particular development
tools not needed when building from snapshot releases - automake,
autoconf, libtool, gtk-doc and dependencies.
The <code>autogen.sh</code> script looks for the newest versions of
the auto* tools and checks that they meet the minimum versions.</p>

<p>Building from development sources rather than from a release also
requires some additional development tools.  Presently this includes
the <a href="http://flex.sourceforge.net/">flex scanner generator</a>
version 2.5.31 or later and the GNU Bison parser generator.
The <code>configure</code> script checks that the minimum versions
are present.  There are optional dependencies that will be used if
present such as MPFR or GMP for decimal arithmetic and PCRE for
regex support.</p>



<h2>2. Configuring and building</h2>

<p>Rasqal uses the GNU automake and autoconf to handle system
dependency checking.  It is developed and built on x86 Linux
and x86 OSX but is also tested on other systems occasionally.
</p>

<p><b>Required</b> (Rasqal will not build without these):</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://librdf.org/raptor/">Raptor RDF Syntax Library</a>
version 2.0.4 or later for parsing RDF, retrieving WWW content from
URIs and other utility classes.
</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Recommended</b> (Optional):
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.pcre.org/">PCRE V2</a> regex library
or another implementing the POSIX regex API.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.mpfr.org/">GNU multiple-precision floating-point library (MPFR)</a> or
<a href="http://gmplib.org/">GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library (GMP)</a>

libraries for decimal arithmetic.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
If some of the recommended libraries are not present some of the
tests will fail and the query engine will fail to handle regex
matches or decimal arithmetic accurately.
</p>


<h3><a id="sec-create-configure" name="sec-create-configure"></a>2.1. Create <code>configure</code> program</h3>

<p>If there is a <code>configure</code> program, skip to the next
section.</p>

<p>If there is no <tt>configure</tt> program, you should create it 
using the <tt>autogen.sh</tt> script, as long as you have the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/automake.html">automake</a> and
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/autoconf.html">autoconf</a>
tools.  This is done by:</p>
<pre>
  ./autogen.sh
</pre>

<p>and you can also pass along arguments intended for configure (see
below for what these are):</p>
<pre>
  ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr/local/somewhere
</pre>

<blockquote>
<p>On OSX you may have to explicitly set the <code>LIBTOOLIZE</code>
variable for the <code>libtoolize</code> utility since on
OSX <code>libtoolize</code> is a different program:</p>
<pre>
  LIBTOOLIZE=glibtoolize ./autogen.sh
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>autogen.sh also checks out the libmtwist GIT submodule and/or
updates it with the latest sources.</p>

<p>Alternatively you can run them by hand (<b>not recommended</b>) with:</p>
<pre>
  aclocal; autoheader; automake --add-missing; autoconf
</pre>
<p><b>however</b> this will not do any of the GIT submodule checkout
or updates that are needed for libmtwist.
</p>

<p>The automake and autoconf tools have many different versions and
at present development is being done with automake 1.11.1 (minimum
version 1.11), autoconf 2.65 (minimum version 2.62) and libtool
2.2.10 (minimum version 2.2.0).  These are only needed when compiling
from GIT sources.  autogen.sh enforces the requirements.
</p>

<p>Rasqal also requires
<a href="http://flex.sourceforge.net/">flex</a> version 2.5.31 or newer
(2.5.4 will not work) and
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/bison.html">GNU Bison</a>
to build lexers and parsers.
These are only required when building from GIT.</p>


<h3>2.2 Options for <tt>configure</tt></h3>

<p>Rasqal's configure supports the following options:</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>--enable-debug</code><br /></dt>
<dd><p>Enable debugging statements for developing the code.  Should
NOT be used with any regular build that is installed since it slows
the code and generates lots of extra output.  This is a maintainer
option.
</p></dd>

<dt><code>--enable-query-languages=</code><em>LANGUAGES</em><br /></dt>
<dd><p>Select the RDF query languages to build from the list:<br />
<code>sparql laqrs</code><br />
The default when this option is omitted is to enable all query languages
except the experimental one, laqrs.  <em>LANGUAGES</em> takes a
space-separated value.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><code>--enable-release</code><br /></dt>
<dd><p>Enable configuration for building a release by not removing
<code>-O</code> options for compiler flags.  This is a maintainer
option.
</p></dd>

<dt><code>--with-digest-library=</code><em>NAME</em><br /></dt>
<dd><p>Pick the message digest library approach to use from the
choices of <tt>mhash</tt> (the default when available),
<tt>gcrypt</tt> (when libgcrypt is available) and <tt>internal</tt>
(always available, providing only MD5 and SHA1).
</p></dd>

<dt><code>--with-gmp=</code><em>PATH</em><br /></dt>
<dd><p>Set the installation path for the
<a href="http://gmplib.org/">GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library (GMP)</a>
if it is not in the standard lib/include prefix.
</p></dd>

<dt><code>--with-libgcrypt-config=</code><em>PATH</em><br /></dt>
<dd><p>Set the path of the libgcrypt <code>libgcrypt-config</code>
program that provides the compiling and linking flags.  Enables
libgcrypt for use as a message digest.
See also <code>--with-digest-library</code>
</p></dd>

<dt><code>--with-memory-signing</code><br /></dt>
<dd><p>Enable signing of memory allocations so that when memory is
allocated with malloc() and released free(), a check is made that the
memory was allocated in the same library.</p></dd>

<dt><code>--with-mpfr=</code><em>PATH</em><br /></dt>
<dd><p>Set the installation path for the
<a href="http://www.mpfr.org/">GNU multiple-precision floating-point library (MPFR)</a>
if it is not in the standard lib/include prefix.
</p></dd>

<dt><code>--with-random-approach=</code><em>ALGO</em><br /></dt>
<dd><p>Pick the random number generator approach to use from the
choices of <tt>mtwist</tt> (the default - this is bundled with rasqal
and can be used without any additional installs), <tt>gmp</tt> (when
GMP is available and used for decimals), <tt>random_r</tt> (glibc
initstate_r and random_r), <tt>rand_r</tt> (POSIX rand_r),
<tt>random</tt> (BSD initstate and random) and <tt>rand</tt> (POSIX
srand and rand).  </p></dd>

<dt><code>--with-regex-library=</code>NAME<br /></dt>
<dd><p>Pick a regex library to use - either <tt>pcre2</tt> (default
and RECOMMENDED)
for the <a href="http://www.pcre.org/">PCRE V2</a>,
or <tt>pcre</tt>tt> for the legacy PCRE V1 (NOT recommended)
or <tt>posix</tt> a POSIX regex implementation in the C library
</p>
</dd>

<dt><code>--with-pcre-config=</code><em>NAME</em><br /></dt>
<dd><p>Set the path to the <a href="http://www.pcre.org/">PCRE</a> pcre-config program</p></dd>

<dt><code>--with-pcre2-config=</code><em>NAME</em><br /></dt>
<dd><p>Set the path to the <a href="http://www.pcre.org/">PCRE V2</a> pcre2-config program</p></dd>

</dl>


<h3>2.3 Configuring</h3>

<p>The default configuration will install into /usr/local:
</p>
<pre>
   ./configure
</pre>

<p>To install into the standard Unix / Linux (and also Cygwin) system
directory, use:
</p>
<pre>
   ./configure --prefix=/usr
</pre>


<p>Append to the line any additional options you need like this:
</p>
<pre>
   ./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-query-languages=sparql
</pre>

<p>The <code>configure</code> script uses
<a href="http://pkg-config.freedesktop.org/wiki/"><code>pkg-config(1)</code></a>
to find an installed version of Raptor . If configure reports that it
cannot find Raptor, try <code>$ pkg-config raptor2 --modversion</code>
on the command line and if there is an error or nothing is shown,
then pkg-config is not properly installed and configured.  Use 'man
pkg-config(1)' to read how to set <code>PKG_CONFIG_PATH</code> which
should include a directory where <code>raptor2.pc</code> is installed.
When it is correct, the above command will return the Raptor version.
</p>

<h3>2.4 Compiling</h3>

<p>Compile the library and the <tt>roqet</tt> utility with:</p>
<pre>
   make
</pre>
<p>Note: GNU make is probably required which may be called
gmake or gnumake if your system has a different make available too.
</p>


<h3>2.5 Testing</h3>

<p>Rasqal has a built-in test suite that can be invoked with:
</p>
<pre>
  make check
</pre>

<p>which should emit lots of exciting test messages to the screen but
conclude with something like:<br />
  <tt>All </tt><em>n</em><tt> tests passed</tt><br />
if everything works correctly.  There might be some regex
or decimal tests that fail if no POSIX regex library or multiple
precision numeric library was available when Rasqal was compiled.</p>


<h3>2.6 Installing</h3>

<p>Install the library and the <tt>roqet</tt> utility into the area
configure with <code>--prefix</code> (or /usr/local if not given)
with:</p>
<pre>
   make install
</pre>
<p>Note: This may require root access if the destination area is
a system directory such as /usr.  In that case you may have to do
<code>sudo make install</code>.
</p>


<h2>3. Using the library</h2>

<h3>3.1 Documentation</h3>

<p>Rasqal includes a reference manual for the library but no tutorial
at this time.  This is installed into
<em>PREFIX</em><code>/share/gtk-doc/html/rasqal</code>
and is also available from the
<a href="http://librdf.org/rasqal/api/">Rasqal web site</a>.
</p>

<h3>3.2 Examples</h3>

<p>At present, to get a good idea of how to use Rasqal in a program,
check out the source for roqet in src/roqet.c which uses the library
extensively with the recommended APIs.
</p>


<h3>3.3 roqet utility</h3>

<p>Rasqal provides an RDF query utility program called
<em>roqet</em> which can do a variety of query operations on local
and remote data, local and remote queries and running queries on
SPARQL protocol services.
</p>

<p>See the roqet manual page for full details using 'man roqet'
or read the HTML version in docs/roqet.html or on the
<a href="http://librdf.org/rasqal/roqet.html">Rasqal website</a>.
